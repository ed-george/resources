About hackathons
----------------

Hackathons (or hack days) are super awesome events where people meet to build cool things. They're usually 24 hours straight programming/tinkering/building. Everybody gets involved, helps make something, then shows it to everybody else. Don't worry if you haven't been to one before, come along and you'll learn tons and have some great fun. Hackathons are pretty lighthearted and everyone's very helpful. Check out some past hackathons HackSoc have been to here: http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/category/news/

Preparing for a hackathon
-------------------------

1. Look up the Sponsors' APIs. Usually the hackathon sponsors will have prizes for people who use their APIs. It's a great opportunity to learn something cool you can add to your apps. Here's a list of tutorials for several common APIs: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis

Essentials to bring to a hackathon
----------------------------------

1. A laptop!
2. Don't forget your power cable!
3. Any cables or adapters you might need. Don't worry about bringing too many cables, it's better to have spares.
4. Warm and comfortable clothes. Trust us, you don't want to code while cold. And you're going to be hacking for a long time, so pyjamas or onsies are totally acceptable.
5. Sleeping bag. You probably won't get much time to sleep, but when you conk out for a couple of hours, you want to be comfortable.
6. A bit of money - just in case.

Extra things to bring
---------------------

1. If you want to bring any electronics like Arduinos or Pis, bring them along. But we'll always have a few spare for you to play with if you don't own one.

Things you don't need to bring
------------------------------

1. Red Bull. There will be plenty.
2. Food. There'll be some of that too. But you might need something for the journey.
